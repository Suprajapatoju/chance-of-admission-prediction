# Chance of Admission Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts the **chance of admission** of candidates into graduate programs based on various academic and exam features. This project performs data analysis, builds regression models, and evaluates their performance — all within a well-documented Jupyter Notebook.

## 📊 Project Highlights

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Detailed investigation of the dataset to understand feature distributions and correlations.  
- **Data Visualization:** Using Matplotlib and Seaborn for insightful plots.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Preprocessing and selecting relevant features for better model performance.  
- **Regression Models:** Implementation of Linear Regression and other models to predict admission chances.  
- **Model Evaluation:** Performance metrics like R² score, Mean Squared Error, etc., to assess accuracy.
